We have conducted an study with human participants. This study aimed to look at how a hypothetical defendants' detention prior to their main trial affects their verdict in terms of being convicted.
All participants consented to participating in the study, were over 18 years old, residing in the UK and fluent in English.
Each participant provides 2 outputs: a numerical value between 0 and 100, and a written answer (string).
You will be in charge of conducting a qualitative analysis for this study so we are providing you with sufficient background information and the vignettes the participants saw.

# Design
The study presented participants with a vignette describing the  result  of  a  pre-trial  decision  about  whether  a  defendant was detained  (not  granted  bail) or  not.  
Two independent variables were manipulated:
- Explanation type → Unexplained vs Explained
- Detainment type → Not detained vs Detained
This resulted in four conditions:
1. Explained Detained
2. Explained  Not Detained
3. Unexplained Detained
4. Unexplained Not Detained

Participants were not aware of:
- which condition they were being assigned to
- what the goal of the study was
- how many conditions there were in total
- what elements were being manipulated

# Story
To better help you understand the study, we will disclose the scenario for each condition below. Some elements are common to all conditions but some are not, so for clarity, below is the overall structure of the story:
1. Brief information → common to all conditions
2. Explanation type & Detainment type information → condition specific
3. Question → common to all conditions

## Brief information
> You are part of a jury in a case in which a man, X, has been accused of a crime.
> X has been accused of burglary.  
> X attends a pre-trial hearing with Judge Armstrong to determine if he will be detained up until his trial.

## Explanation type & Detainment type information
### Explained Detained
> Judge Armstrong ALWAYS detains suspects for burglary cases and therefore X WILL be detained up until his trial.
### Explained  Not Detained
> Judge Armstrong NEVER detains suspects for burglary cases and therefore X will NOT be detained up until his trial.
### Unexplained Detained
> The judge DECIDES that X WILL be detained up until his trial.
### Unexplained Not Detained
> The judge DECIDES that X will NOT be detained up until his trial.

## Question
> At this early stage, what do you personally think is the probability that X will be found guilty ofmburglary at trial?

> Please explain your prediction, giving as many reasons as possible.

The first question was quantitative and participants responded by selecting a number on a slider between 0 and 100.
In the second question participants were asked to explain their reasoning in an open text box.
