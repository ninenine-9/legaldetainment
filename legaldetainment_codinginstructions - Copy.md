You are given a table to fill in for the qualitative analysis.  
We will outline:  
- how the table is designed  
- the coding scheme  
    - code type and options  
    - code definitions  
    - examples   
- what you must do  

# Table structure  
The table contains the following columns:  
- Pno → pre-populated with each participant's number, this is our index  
- Qual → pre-populated with each participant's text answer from the study  
- GuiltMoreLikely → empty, binary, to be coded by you 
- GuiltLessLikely → empty, binary, to be coded by you 
- NoInformation_Evidence → empty, binary, to be coded by you 
- InnocentUntilProvenGuilty → empty, binary, to be coded by you 
- Confound → empty, binary, to be coded by you 
- Unclassified_Other → empty, binary, to be coded by you 
  
Binary codes means each code can either be "Yes" or "No".  
GuiltMoreLikely, GuiltLessLikely and NoInformation/Evidence are mutually exclusive, meaning that if a participant is coded as "Yes" in one of these three codes, it must be coded as "No" in the two remaining.
Unclassified/Other is the only fully mutually exclusive code, meaning that if a participant is coded as "Yes", they should be coded as "No".

# Codes  
Here, we will detail each code.   

## GuiltMoreLikely
Definition: The participant states that, because the judge denied the defendant bail, the judge must know something about the defendant, such as that they don’t have an alibi, or a criminal history, which means they are more likely to be found guilty at the main trial

## GuiltLessLikely
Definition: The participant states that, because the judge granted the defendant bail, the judge must know something about the defendant, such as that they do have an alibi, or have no criminal history, which means they are more likely to be found innocent at the main trial

## NoInformation_Evidence 
Definition: The participant states that there is no / not enough information / evidence to make the judgement asked of them

## InnocentUntilProvenGuilty
Definition: The participant either explicitly says ‘innocent until proven guilty’, says something similar e.g. ‘innocent until guilty’ or expresses this sentiment in another way e.g. that none of the information matters until they are proven guilty so we shouldn’t prejudge

## Confound
Definition: The participant states that it will be the same judge at the main trial as the start AND/OR the participant states that because of the detainment / lack of detainment, the judge may be e.g. biased against them or more likely to find them guilty / not guilty

## Unclassified_Other
Definition: Not one of the above – either something else or can’t discern thought process at all
